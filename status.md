Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Implemented images, and made foundational code for the visual novel

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

need to make a script, need to put more images in. (OPTIONAL: Music, BG, GUI)

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The script.rpy that I'm doing in Visual Studio is not linked up to the script.rpy on Git Hub. I think it's because they may be different files, but even knowing that doesn't help me resolve the problem
