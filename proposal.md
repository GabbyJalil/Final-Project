# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Arch Semester Visual Novel

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Gabby
- flipping through the different projects made by 2 Arch students throughout this semester and their thought process for each. Similar to an archive

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

(Should we introduce what the freshman arch students are doing this past fall semester and a table of contents for each project, Iar?)
Gabby
- the user has the option to choose me or Iar's projects through the spring semester. After choosing, the user has the option to move forward or backward to see the projects and our thoughts on it. After the user gets to the end of seeing all of that one student's  project, they can choose to see the other person's  projects or end the program?

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Iaroslav Butin, tur66950@temple.edu, Elmira Talebianaraki(same TA)

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Gabby
- being able to choose which arch student you want to see projects of

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Gabby
- being able to flip through the different projects

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- being able to look at the other's person's projects after seeing the last student's. It'd also be nice if we could receive some user input on what they think.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
