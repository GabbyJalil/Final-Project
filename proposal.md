# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Ideal Architecture Generator

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Choose a variety of buildings to like and after some trials of picking and choosing the program will generate an image of architecture based on the user's likes on buildings

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Similar to Instagram, the user would scroll through a series of images of buildings. Each image has a like and dislike button, in which the user can choose between the options. After scrolling through a few images, a pop-up will appear in which the program will ask the user if they want to see their "ideal building". The user can pick yes or no. No leads to the pop-up disappearing and the user will be able to continue to scroll. Yes would lead to a generated "ideal building" for the user and then the program would end.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Iaroslav Butin, tur66950@temple.edu, Elmira Talebianaraki(same TA)

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The user can add likes to a certain building and scroll through a few buildings.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Being able to narrow down options between buildings based on the user's preference and generating an ai image based the user's choices

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

making it an application that is user friendly and has an infinite amount of architecture that the user can choose from

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We would need to learn how to implimate buttons that would lead to a destination. We would need to research AI and how to generate a image based off the algorithim from the user. We would need to learn how to import images. We would need to know how to implimat the scrolling option. We would need to know how to do formating to make it look pretty. 

As for who will do what, that is to be determined. Iaroslav is in Dubai to see his family since Friday, so we haven't had a conversation on who does what yet and we've only had a brief conversation about the final project on Friday, 3/29/2024.
